Title: Camshaft Position Sensor (CPS) Changed

The CPS has been changed in the car. Old CPS seem to be without of
physical defect aside from oil coverage. Car engine still not turning over.
May be gap between sensor and fly wheel (?) is too wide, but uncertain.

Additionally, broke alternator bolt. Need to find replacement.
